                <p><em>Computer Science Undergraduate Student @ <a href = "https://www.concordia.ca/">Concordia University, Montreal</a></em></p>
                <p>I am a Computer Science honours undergraduate student and a member of Career Edge at the Institute of Co-operative education at Concordia University, MontrÃ©al. I am fascinated by the world of computer science and the endless possibilities it offers. I enjoy solving algorithmic problems and optimizing my already solved problems to cut down on complexities.<br>
                  I am constantly exploring the scope of computer science and developing my programming and optimization skills by giving myself coding challenges and participating in coding competitions online and am always looking forward for opportunities that can enhance my skills and capabilities and make me a better version of myself.<br>
                 I also love to cook.<br>
                 For more information regarding me, you can visit my LinkedIn profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanyamkadd/" target="_blank">here.</a><br>
